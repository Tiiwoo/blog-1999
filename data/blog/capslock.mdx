The QWERT keyboard has a fundamental design fault that I can't tolerate:
It puts the "CapsLock" in the middle row. This key is almost useless
because you can always use your left pinky finger to hold down the Shift
key to type uppercase letters.

Think about this: your left pinky is the finger that moves most often
using the QWERT keyboard. Almost all shortcut keys require the use of
it. It has to move up and down to press Ctrl, Shift, Alt (Option), and
Command (Super, Windows). However, the most convenient key for it to
press - in other words, the key that it can reach naturally without much
effort - is CapsLock! The most useless key in the left half of the
keyboard!

Your right pinky feels much more comfortable than your left pinky. The
only thing it needs to do is to press the "Enter" key. I mean, it's not
fair! Your right pinky can do its important work without jumping around,
while your left pinky is too busy finding the correct modifier key to
press!

Some keyboard manufacturers want to solve this problem. For example, the
famous HHKB keyboard replaces CapsLock with Ctrl. The CapsLock instead
becomes a combination of Fn+Tab. According to the frequency of CapsLock
usage, this is undoubtedly a good change.

But I don't like HHKB for the lack of function keys. As a keyboard
designed for programmers, aren't F1-F12 essential for them too? Just
imagine how many keys you must press to switch TTY in Linux.

I do prefer my "clicky" standard keyboard with brown switches. But it
doesn't mean my left pinky finger has to suffer. Some changes to the
CapsLock key can make it easier to use. For example, remap CapsLock to
other modifier keys.

## Remapping

Remapping a key is easy. There is software like
[Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on macOS
or [KMonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad) on Linux to
handle the annoying details. What matters is to design a shortcut system
with keys that make sense.

Yes. A shortcut system must make sense. Otherwise, it's just a
collection of random gorilla presses. Here is an example of a sensible
shortcut system: Control and Command are separate keys for different
works in macOS. All the terminal stuff uses Control, which means you can
press Ctrl+C to send SIGINT to a task to terminate it. At the same time,
Command+C is used to copy the outputs to the clipboard. This design
allows "copy" operations to use the same shortcut keys globally. In
contrast, a bad design is that you must use Ctrl+Shift+C to copy in a
Linux terminal emulator, breaking global consistency.

A friend of mine used to interchange CapsLock and Esc. He was blindly
enthusiastic about vim, and after a heated discussion, he recently
upgraded to a more advanced keyboard diagram. When CapsLock is pressed
alone, it acts like Esc. When the CapsLock key is pressed with another
key, it works like Ctrl.

## Hyper and Meh

I'm a vim user who only knows how to quit it (I'm kidding). In most
cases, I use VSCode with a vim keymap binding. I'm not interested in
making CapsLock another Ctrl. So I remap CapsLock to a complex
combination of Ctrl+Shift+Option+Command (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Windows for
Windows users). The modified key is the so-called **Hyper** key by the
advanced users in the forum.

Why would I need a "Hyper" key anyway? That is because I'm a programmer
who shamefully uses IDEs. They define so many keyboard shortcuts that I
cannot avoid conflict with them when creating my own. So I decided to
give my shortcuts a unique trigger. That is when the Hyper key comes in.

There is another key called **Meh** used by some advanced users as an
addition to the Hyper key. Meh usually refers to combining
Ctrl+Shift+Option (Ctrl+Shift+Alt for Windows users). Guess which key I
remapped for Meh? It's the Tab key!

  So, you mapped your CapsLock to some weird modifier keys and wrote a
  whole blog about it? What's the point?

Yes, it may sound boring until I show you how
amazing it works with my window manager.

## Window Manager

I'm a proud user of window managers. Mainly, I use **tiling** window
managers. A window manager (WM) is software that controls the placement
and appearance of windows. Tiling window managers "tile" the windows
so that none are overlapping. When there is only one window in the
display, it takes up the whole screen. When you open another window,
they will automatically share the screen in half and half.

I analyze my workflow regularly to increase my productivity. The most
frequent scenario of my daily work is opening an editor and writing
codes. About half the time, I open the browser to search for
documentation. Then I switch between the editor and browser frequently
to figure out why the code I copied from Stackoverflow doesn't work.
About one-third of the time, I open a terminal to run tests.

As a result, in 80% of my work time, I need more than two windows open
with no overlap. It can be challenging to find and manage these windows
on a cluttered desktop. So I use a window manager to help me do that. I
also try to avoid using the mouse, as having my hands on the keyboard
helps me to type and check the code. So I need a shortcut to switch
between windows quickly and precisely.

Command+Tab (or Alt+Tab for Windows users) cannot count as "precisely"
because I always get the wrong window on another virtual desktop with
it. Instead, with the power of window managers, I use Hyper and Meh to
switch between them.

| Keyboard Function | Shortcuts                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hyper + HJKL      | focuses on windows on the left, down, up, or right.       |
| Meh + HJKL        | swaps the current window to the left, down, up, or right. |
| Hyper + 1-9       | switches between virtual desktop 1~9.                     |
| Meh + 1-9         | move the current window to virtual desktop 1~9.           |

Since the browser and terminal are so frequently used in my workflow, I
created two shortcuts to open them. Hyper+Return creates a new terminal
window, and Hyper+\ opens a new Chrome window.

Using the keyboard to switch between windows can significantly reduce
the frequency of using the mouse, thus motivating you to become a
keyboardist. Recall that my Hyper key is actually the CapsLock key on
the keyboard. When swapping between code and terminal, I simply move my
pinky finger from 'A' to one key away to the left while keeping my
right hand still. Now my pinky and I are both happy with it.

When these shortcuts form muscle memory, it becomes so natural, precise,
and fast that it's as if I'm using my mind to interact with the
computer. I heard someone is working on window switching based on an
attention mechanism (using a webcam to capture human eye movement).
Until that happens, boost your productivity with the methods I've
described today!
