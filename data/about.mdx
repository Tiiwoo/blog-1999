Hi, my name is Shi Wenxuan (çŸ³æ–‡è½©). I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science at the Southern University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am a member of the _COMPASS_ lab supervised by Professor Fengwei Zhang. I will join Northwestern University as a PhD student in this fall.

I started coding in primary school, and I have always loved exploring the computer world. I got several awards in Programming Contest, such as NOIP and ICPC. Besides, I am fond of designing and developing practical applications (like this blog system), about which I have written many [posts](/).
